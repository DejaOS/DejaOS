# How to Install dejaOS  
As a JavaScript runtime environment, dejaOS does not require any additional installation, as it is provided with our devices.  

## Required Development Environment  
To set up the dejaOS development environment, you need to install the following:  
1. **VSCode**: [Official Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
2. **Node.js**: [Official Download](https://nodejs.org/), version 20 or higher.  
3. **DXIDE**: This is the VSCode plugin, which can be directly installed from the VSCode Extensions Marketplace: [DXIDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dxide.dxide)

> Currently, the development environment does not support macOS and Linux, primarily because devices are not recognized via USB in these environments. We plan to enhance this functionality in the future.  

## Network Requirements  
A wide range of official modules is available for download, so you need to have internet access to download the necessary ones locally.
