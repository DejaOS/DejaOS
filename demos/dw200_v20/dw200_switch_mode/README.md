Dev devices are usually used for application debugging, and once debugging is complete, the application should be installed on production devices. However, in special cases, we can also support converting a development device into a production device, which requires switching modes. We usually use QR codes to switch modes. For example, scanning one QR code switches to "prod" mode, and scanning another switches back to "dev" mode. This demo is intended to show how to switch modes using QR codes.
